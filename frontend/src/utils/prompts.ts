      "Consider for a minute the person you are sending a video to. Are they in the same area as you? If not, what might they find interesting to hear about? If you’re in Pennsylvania in the winter and they’re in Costa Rica, might they want to hear about the snowstorm outside your window? Something as mundane as having to toss salt on the sidewalk might be fascinating to someone who has never experienced such temperatures.",

      "Who is an athlete or a musician or actor that you think is over or underrated? Why do you think this? Consider what are the specific things that have led you to this opinion and share a few details. ",

    body:
      "Sometimes having someone completely unconnected to your everyday life is the best person to get advice from. If you have something that is going on in your life that you are struggling to find a solution to, or you just need a sounding board, who better than your video pen pal? While it probably isn’t great to always be negative and gloomy in communication, there is nothing wrong with sharing concerns and problems sometimes. The bonus is that most people want to be helpful if they can be, so your pen pal will probably be glad to give their thoughts, or at least sympathies.",

      "No matter how boring and obvious your family might seem to you, there’s a good chance that they will seem entertaining to a stranger. Or, at least, your description of them might be. Talk about a sibling and why they’re utterly infuriating. Share a family legend about a parent or grandparent that gets retold at family gatherings. If you have children, recount some of your favorite moments of them growing up. And if, as some people, you don’t have a close relationship with family, you can always tell the story about why you don’t. ",
